              <h3 class="h3-facts">The Fact</h3>
              <p>My story is different. I took the first two terms of CST in-person at the <a
                  href="https://www.bcit.ca">
                  British Columbia Institute of Technology</a> Burnaby campus from the
                instruction of Bruce Link and Dennis Richards, and realized I wanted to learn the material while
                beginning
                my career. I voluntarily chose to enter Flex after speeding up the process of developing personal
                projects. I completed
                Term 1 with an 88% average grade and 3.4 GPA. Term 1 was a strong introduction to programming material,
                and term 2 contined that trend, but this is
                where I decided to take a step back and spend more time developing projects and begin a job hunt.
              </p>
              <h3>The Solution</h3>
              <p>I ended up on a phone call with CST program head Kevin Cudihee, I told him who I am, what my plan is,
                and
                how I want to get there. This
                phone call single-handedly changed my path, and mistakeningly turned into a 40 minute conversation. He
                responded effectively and assured me my education plan would be met. </p><br>
              <p>The conversation set a course for a new beginning, one that I should had started two terms
                earlier. It was apparent to me education was not about a race to the finish line, but a steady,
                consistent,
                journey for knowledge, that must be developed and harnassed into a foundation that lasts a
                lifetime.
                That foundation began the day I started my programming journey.</p>
